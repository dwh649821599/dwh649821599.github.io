<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the College of Computer Science and Engineering at Northeastern University. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the same institution, advised by Prof. Chaolu Feng. My research interest includes medical image analysis, continual learning, and computer vision.
