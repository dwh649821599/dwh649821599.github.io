<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the College of Computer Science and Engineering at Northeastern University. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the same institution, advised by Prof. Chaolu Feng. My research interest includes medical image analysis, multi-modal, continual learning, and computer vision. For more information, please refer to my [\[CV\]](https://dwh649821599.github.io/cv.pdf).
